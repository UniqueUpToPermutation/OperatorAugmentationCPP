# C++ Operator Augmentation

This is a small testbed of problem for operator augmentation. All the methods in our paper "Operator Augmentation for
elliptic systems" are implemented herein.

## Prerequisites

This testbed requires the Eigen linear algebra library, as well as the LEMON graph library.
To build the test bed you will need CMake.

## Configuration

To update the configuration, please see config.json, make sure that config.json is in the same
directory as your binary.
